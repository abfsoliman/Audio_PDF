# Description

This Python script uses PyPDF2 and pyttsx3 libraries to extract text from specific pages (Prologue Chapter) of a PDF file ('The ride of a lifetime book by Bob Iger') and convert it into an audio file ('story.mp3'). The code initializes a text-to-speech engine with customized settings and extracts text from the PDF, combining them into a single audio file.

#### Note: 
You need to install the required libraries

`pip install PyPDF2 pyttsx3`
